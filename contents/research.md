We **reshape human-environment modeling** to identify **critical leverage points** for **sustainability transitions**. The dynamics of collective action at scale – in which large collectives of intelligent actors in complex environments seek ways to improve their joint well-being – are critical for a sustainable future, yet unresolved. **The fundamental question is: Are we, as the human species, intelligent enough to maintain our life-support system and organize a good life for all?** To move forward with this challenge, we develop **[formal models of collective learning](]((https://barfusslab.github.io/pyCRLD)**
to better understand how in complex environments, individual decisions become collective action for a sustainable future.

We are **sustainability system scientists**. No single academic discipline alone is up to the task. We are a young, strongly evolving, interdisciplinary team building bridges between Complex System Science, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Cognitive Science, Social-Ecological Resilience, and Sustainability Economics. To merge all of these perspectives, we practice humility in collective learning.

We focus on excellence in developing **theory-driven computational models**. They bridge mathematical with computational modeling to eventually reshape our mental and verbal models of Nature-Society relationships. We make our models and their assumptions fully transparent, open source, and reproducible. We also educate the next generation of sustainability system modelers. Why? To **initiate large-scale collective learning for a sustainable future**.
